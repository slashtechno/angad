          <p>As of the time of writing, the newst iPad to be added to Apple's lineup is the M1 iPad Pro. The question is, is it really and iPad, or is it a computer</p>
<!-- read more would be here -->

<p> Basically Apple took a Macbook Air, took away the keyboard, and made Mac OS into iPad OS. I think that the price of the iPad itself, for the hardware, is really, really good. Buying this iPad is a good deal in the sense that you are getting a very powerful machine. However, iPad OS is turning this very powerful machine, into a 2 in 1 Chromebook with more app selection. However, if iPad OS is replaced with Mac OS or another desktop operating system, it would be incredible. The M1 iPad has such a simmilar processer to the $1,299 Macbook Pro, that it makes you question if the M1 iPad is really a tablet. Even better if this iPad had a desktop operating system, it could have been a $700 Macbook with a touchscreen, and a keyboard (for another $300 though).
