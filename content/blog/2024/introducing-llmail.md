description: Intoducing LLMail - a project allowing you to interact with LLMs/AI via email

## Motivation
I've seen projects where people bring *x* technology to devices that existed long before the technology existed. For example, while writing this, I learned about [Web Rendering Proxy](https://github.com/tenox7/wrp) (WRP) which renders websites as a GIF or PNG but uses HTML image maps to allow the client to interact with the webpage. Email is a technology that's been around since 1971 and will likely continue to be prevalent. Thus, making an email chatbot that used Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate responses seemed cool. In addition, with various educational institutions and workplaces blocking access to LLMs, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, using email as a proof-of-concept to bypass these restrictions. Granted, for this purpose it would probably be more effective to just use a different client or service.
