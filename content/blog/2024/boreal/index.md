### Some background  
### Hack Club  
I joined [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) in late-May of 2024. Hack Club is an incredible non-profit organization comprised of over 35,000 teen programmers, hackers, and makers. I joined as it seemed like a cool community, in addition to their YSWS initiatives. An example is [Arcade](https://hackclub.com/arcade) wherein you can earn stuff from laptops to microcontrollers, simply by working on personal projects.  
What I found incredible, however, were the [hackathons](https://hackathons.hackclub.com/). Recent hackathons have included [Apocalypse](https://apocalypse.hackclub.com/), which took place in Shopify Headquarters, and [The Trail](https://trail.hackclub.com/), a hackathon combined with a hike. One of the most recent
hackathons was [The Boreal Express](https://boreal.hackclub.com/) [The Boreal Express](https://boreal.hackclub.com/).
### The Boreal Express  
I learned about The Boreal Express shortly after joining Hack Club. Boreal was a hackathon that was supposed to be a transcontinental journey across Canada. It was taking place onboard The Canadian, a train known for its beautiful views. Only 50 applicants would be accepted for this all-expenses-paid journey. Initially, I thought about applying but didn't prioritize it. I applied a week or two later. Upon submission of the application, I was told that I should receive a response by June 10. It was June 15.
Assuming I missed the deadline, I moved on. I also couldn't imagine myself being accepted as I had just joined Hack Club. Five days later, on June 20, I received a message regarding my application and if I would be open to a call regarding my application. I was somehow accepted out of 600 applicants.  

## Getting to Vancouver  
I flew to Vancouver along with one of my friends (who was also accepted) to Vancouver one day prior to the opening ceremony. The next day, along with the other attendees, who reached one day prior, we went to Jericho Beach and got to meet the others who were arriving.
