[{"content":"I am slashtechno. I am a programmer. I started programming at a young age, and when I created my Github account, my interest in programming skyrocketed. Currently, many of my programs aim to increase quality of life by simplifying tasks. Above all else, I enjoy tinkering with software (and sometimes hardware.) Whether it be Linux, Windows, networking, or something else entirely, the possibilites of what can be done with computers are endless.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t be evil.\n","permalink":"https://new.slashtechno.com/about/","summary":"About me, slashtechno","title":"About"},{"content":"I am slashtechno.
