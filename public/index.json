[{"content":"I started using Github Actions a couple months ago. While I\u0026rsquo;m not a power user of Github Actions, I still find it to be powerful.\nWhat is Github Actions? Github Actions is a service that allows you to run code when certain events happen. For example, you can run code when a pull request is opened, when a commit is pushed, or when a release is published.It allows for continuous integration and continuous deployment, but also management of pull requests, issues, and more.\nMy use cases I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Github Actions to automatically deploy my website. I use Hugo to generate my website, and I use Github Pages to host it. I also use it to automatically build and release my Go programs.\nContinuous deployment Before I started learning Go, I used Python. When I started using Go, I liked being able to compile my code. I learned of cross compilation, and started using xgo to cross compile my code. However, at that time, I was running xgo locally and manually uploading the binaries to Github and publishing the release. After publishing two releases with this strategy, I decided to automate the process. I decided to start using Github Actions. I discovered an xgo step\rwhich I could use in my workflow. I found an action for nightly releases, but unfortunately realized that is was intended to update the files associated with a release, not re-release with the updated files.\nAfter some research I found softprops/action-gh-release\rworked for my use case. However, at that time, a new tag was created with the short commit tag for every new release. I kept using this for a while, before eventually realizing how many tags and releases were being created. I started trying to find a way to delete the old release and tag before creating a new one. I found EndBug/latest-tag\rand Archaholic/action-delete-release\r. I used these two actions to delete the old release and tag before re-releasing.\nAt the time of writing, I use this method. However, I recently found dev-drprasad/delete-tag-and-release\r, which I may switch to.\nExample workflow: name: Continuous Integration on: push: branches: - master jobs: build-and-release: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Cross compile uses: crazy-max/ghaction-xgo@v2 with: xgo_version: latest go_version: 1.19 dest: /home/runner/work/repo-name/builds prefix: prefix - name: Compress releases run: zip -r /home/runner/work/repo-name/binaries.zip /home/runner/work/repo-name/builds/* - name: Delete old release uses: Archaholic/action-delete-release@v1 env: GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} with: tag_name: rolling - name: Update tag uses: EndBug/latest-tag@latest with: ref: rolling - name: Release uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1 with: name: Rolling release prerelease: true tag_name: rolling body: \u0026#34;Latest commit: ${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}\u0026#34; files: | /home/runner/work/repo-name/binaries.zip /home/runner/work/repo-name/builds/* - name: uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3 with: name: binaries path: /home/runner/work/repo-name/builds/* ","permalink":"https://slashtechno.com/blog/2022/my-experience-with-gh-actions/","summary":"I started using Github Actions a couple months ago.
