          <p>I have not published a blog post for a <b>significant</b> amount of time. Because of this, I am considering remaking my website without a blog. The reason is, the blog posts (as of the time of writing), have to be manually added to the website in HTML. Hence, if I were to keep a blog, I would either build my own script that is an oversimplified version of Handlebars or use a static CMS such as Hugo.</p>
          <p>However, there is one possibility. That being I solidify my understanding of HTML, CSS, and manual SEO to make a successful website with a blog. Will it be challenging? Yes. Will it be a better learning experience than a static CMS? Yes.</p>
          <p>If I choose to build a website from scratch, maintenance will become a challenge. However, it will allow for a greater understanding of the code behind the website. Thus, I may attempt to remove the blog from the website homepage. If I have accomplished that, I may try to rebuild the website and temporarily discontinue work on the blog while I am improving my web development skills.</p>
          <p> One more thing, I am aware the articles on my blog are quite short. If I revamp the website, I may focus it much less on the blog and more on showcasing my projects. This would allow for the website to show progress rather than unmaintained and short blog posts.</p>
